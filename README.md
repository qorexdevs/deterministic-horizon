**TL;DR — Past ~22 steps of reasoning, every frontier LLM falls off a cliff. Tools don't.**

</div>

## The 30-second pitch

We tested **12 frontier models** on **state-space search** (the kind of problem BFS solves in milliseconds) — they all collapse at the same wall:

|  | Neural CoT (C1) | **Tool delegation (C3)** |
|---|---:|---:|
| GPT-4o | 28% | **90%** |
| Claude 4.5 Opus | 35% | **94%** |
| o3-mini | 42% | **94%** |
| DeepSeek-R1 | 40% | **93%** |

The wall is at **d\* ∈ [19, 31]** reasoning steps. We give the wall a name (the **Deterministic Horizon**), derive it from attention information theory (Theorem 1), and prove fine-tuning *cannot* push past it (Theorem 4).

> **Why care?** Every agentic system shipping today — code agents, browsers, planners — has to decide *when* to think and *when* to call a tool. Past d\*, "think harder" doesn't help. Hand off.

---

## Five lines of code that ship to your agent today

```python
from deterministic_horizon import should_delegate

# In your planner loop:
if should_delegate(estimated_depth=subproblem_depth, model="claude-4.5-opus"):
    answer = call_tool(subproblem)        # BFS / search / SQL / verifier
else:
    answer = call_llm(subproblem)         # neural chain-of-thought
```

Need the full justification (for logging or eval)?

```python
>>> from deterministic_horizon import delegation_decision
>>> d = delegation_decision(estimated_depth=27, model="claude-4.5-opus")
>>> d.explain()
"At estimated depth d=27, model 'claude-4.5-opus' is expected to reach 31% via CoT
 vs. 92% via tools (horizon d*=28). → delegate."
```

Per-model horizons, when this *doesn't* apply, and three production routing patterns: [docs/when-to-delegate.md](docs/when-to-delegate.md).

## 60-second offline demo (no API keys)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qorexdevs/deterministic-horizon
cd deterministic-horizon
pip install -e .
python examples/demo.py            # offline horizon estimation
python examples/agent_routing.py   # routing pattern, end-to-end
```

You'll see the **horizon estimated live** from a synthetic decoherence simulator, decoherence-model fit R² ≈ 0.97, and a publication-grade figure saved to `analysis/figure_decay.png` (matches the hero image).

Want the **real LLMs**? Add API keys to `.env` (see `.env.example`) and:

```bash
dh evaluate --model gpt-4o --instances data/sample/permutation_n8.json \
            --conditions C1,C3 --output results/gpt4o.json
dh analyze  --results results/gpt4o.json --output analysis/gpt4o/
```

## Headline findings (replicating the paper)

| Metric | Value | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Deterministic Horizon $d^*$ | **19–31 steps** | Beyond this depth, neural CoT accuracy < 50% |
| Tool-integrated accuracy | **86–94%** | Across 8 task domains, 12 models |
| Cross-model correlation $r$ | **0.81–0.91** | Failure is *architectural*, not training-specific |
| Fine-tuning recovery | **+3.2%** | Predicted < 5% by Theorem 4 (vs > 30% by competing theory) |
| Decoherence-model fit | **R² = 0.96** | Super-exponential decay matches data |

## Why this is different from "overthinking" papers

| | Simplicity Bias (prior work) | **Decoherence (this work)** |
|---|---|---|
| Cause | Training preference for short outputs | Information-theoretic capacity bound |
| Fix | Fine-tune on long traces | **No fix** — it's architectural |
| Predicted fine-tune gain | > 30% | **< 5%**  ← we observe 3.2% ✅ |
| Predicted prompt-length gain | > 10% | **< 2%**  ← we observe 1.1% ✅ |
| Predicted cross-model $r$ | Low | **High**  ← we observe 0.86 ✅ |
| Enc-dec advantage | None | **2–3×** ← we observe 2.8× ✅ |

Four divergent predictions, four wins. See §1 of the paper or [docs/theorem-cheatsheet.md](docs/theorem-cheatsheet.md).

## The core theorem (in one line)

The number of distinct states a decoder-only transformer can reliably track is

$$|\mathcal{S}_{\text{track}}| \;\leq\; c(\delta, \rho_{\max}) \cdot 2^{H \cdot \log_2(L/H) \cdot \sqrt{d_h}}$$

with **matching lower bound** (Theorem 2). Per-step error is context-dependent
$\varepsilon(d) = \varepsilon_0 + \gamma\, d/L$ (Theorem 1, derived from attention entropy),
yielding the closed-form Deterministic Horizon

$$d^\star \;\approx\; \frac{1}{\gamma}\Bigl(\sqrt{2 L \ln(1/\alpha)} \;-\; \varepsilon_0\, L\Bigr)$$

and the fine-tuning ceiling $\text{Acc}_{\text{fine-tune}} \leq \text{Acc}_{\text{baseline}} + O(d^\star/d)$.
Proofs in the appendix; ablations in §6. Plain-English version: [docs/theorem-cheatsheet.md](docs/theorem-cheatsheet.md).

## Python API

```python
from deterministic_horizon import (
    PermutationTask, generate_instances, evaluate,
    estimate_horizon, fit_decoherence_model,
    should_delegate, delegation_decision,
)

# 1. Generate task instances
task = PermutationTask(n_elements=8, seed=42)
instances = task.generate_instances(n_instances=400, min_depth=4, max_depth=40)

# 2. Evaluate a model (requires an API key in .env)
results = evaluate(model="gpt-4o", instances=instances, conditions=["C1", "C3"])

# 3. Estimate the horizon
horizon = estimate_horizon(results, threshold=0.5)
print(f"d* = {horizon['d_star']:.1f}  (R² = {horizon['r_squared']:.3f})")

# 4. Use it in your own agent's routing decision
should_delegate(estimated_depth=horizon['d_star'] + 5, model="gpt-4o")  # → True
```

### Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
| **C1** | Neural chain-of-thought (standard prompting) |

## FAQ (highlights)

<details>
<summary><b>Is the demo cherry-picked?</b></summary>

No. The demo uses a *synthetic* reasoner whose per-step error follows the exact context-dependent model from the paper (Theorem 1). The cross-model empirical numbers in `results/paper/` come from real API calls — 12 models × 5 conditions × 8 tasks × 500 instances × 3 seeds = 720,000 evaluations, $3,420 in API cost.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from "transformers can't do X" papers?</b></summary>

Prior expressivity work proves what transformers *cannot compute in principle*. We show what frontier models *cannot reliably execute in practice*, give a closed-form bound on the wall, and prove fine-tuning cannot move it. The Deterministic Horizon is a usable engineering quantity, not an asymptotic.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this mean reasoning models are useless?</b></summary>

Opposite — it tells you exactly *when* to use them and *when* to delegate. Past $d^*$, neural CoT is a coin flip; tools win by 50–70 percentage points.
