# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. This project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Snapshot test pinning `MODEL_HORIZONS` to the paper's Table 3 values (#2)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-14

Initial public release accompanying the ICML 2026 paper *"The Deterministic
Horizon: When Extended Reasoning Fails and Tool Delegation Becomes Necessary"*.

### Added
- Five experimental conditions (C1–C5): neural CoT, direct, tool-integrated, length-encouraged, fine-tuned
- Three task families: `PermutationTask`, `FSATask`, `ArithmeticTask` — each with a BFS oracle
- Unified model interface across OpenAI / Anthropic / DeepSeek / local HF models
- State-Space Jaccard (SSJ) metric with precision/recall decomposition
- Step-to-First-Error (SFE) metric
- Super-exponential decay fit (Theorem 1) and bootstrap CI for the Deterministic Horizon $d^*$
- Cross-model correlation analysis
- `dh` CLI (`generate`, `evaluate`, `analyze`, `train`)
- **Practitioner decision helpers** — `should_delegate()`, `delegation_decision()`,
  `expected_neural_accuracy()`, `horizon_for()` — turn Theorem 1 into a single-line
  branch you can paste into an agent's planner loop
- Offline demo (`examples/demo.py`) — no API keys required, ~10 seconds runtime
- Production-pattern example (`examples/agent_routing.py`) — end-to-end agent
  routing using `should_delegate`, no API keys required
- Quickstart notebook (`notebooks/01_quickstart.ipynb`)
- Pre-generated sample instances + sample results for one-click reproduction
- Documentation under `docs/`: when-to-delegate, theorem cheat-sheet,
  architecture overview, reproducing guide, FAQ
- Continuous integration (GitHub Actions) on Linux + macOS + Windows
  with lint + tests + wheel build
- Issue / PR templates, Code of Conduct, Dependabot, and link-check workflow
- Optional dependency groups: `[openai]`, `[anthropic]`, `[local]`, `[viz]`, `[dev]`, `[all]`

### Reproducibility
- All experiments seeded with `{42, 2024, 2025}`
- Wilson score CIs for binomial proportions
- Holm–Bonferroni multiple-comparison correction
- TOST equivalence testing for null-result claims
